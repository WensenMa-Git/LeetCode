Disadvantages of Round Robin Scheduling:
- Round-robin scheduling, like other first-come, first-served methods, doesn't give special priority to more important tasks.
- This means an urgent request doesn't get handled any faster than other requests in queue.
- The best round robin-based systems will include a tool that allows you to suspend the usual priorities for a "rush job."
